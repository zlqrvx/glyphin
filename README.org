#+TITLE: glyphin.el

Glyphin is an emacs minor mode for inputting unicode symbols. It is heavily inspired by the [[http://xahlee.info/emacs/emacs/xmsi-math-symbols-input.html][xah-math-input]] mode.

* Usage
You can enable glyphin mode locally in the current buffer with M-x glyphin-mode
Alternativly, you can turn on glyphin mode globally with M-x global-glyphin-mode

With glyphin mode enabled, you can replace the text before point with the C-<space> keybinding.

To use glyphin mode, type the input code that you want to expand (for example type =sum= if you want to input the summation symbol) then press C-SPC and the word =sum= will be replaced with the corresponding symbol (=∑=).

* Examples
Greek letters:
| Input | Unicode |
|-------+---------|
| a     | α       |
| w     | ω       |
| d     | δ       |
| x     | ξ       |

Math symbols:
| Input  | Unicode |

| inf    | ∞       |
| in     | ∈       |
| nabla  | ∇       |
| otimes | ⊗       |
| sum    | ∑       |
| bbR    | ℝ       |
